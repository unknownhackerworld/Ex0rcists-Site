      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; We are Ex0rcists, an academic CTF team incubated by St. Joseph’s Group of Institutions, India. Since our formation, we have carved a place in the global cybersecurity community through relentless participation, research, and competition. Ranked consistently among India’s best, our current standing is #24 in India and #338 worldwide (CTFtime 2025).<br/><br />

        Our journey is marked by a trail of challenges conquered across the globe. In 2025, we battled in prestigious arenas like Nullcon HackIM (Berlin & Goa), HITCON CTF, DiceCTF, Shakti CTF, CryptoCTF, DownUnderCTF, and secured strong finishes in ACECTF 1.0 (#32), BCACTF 6.0 (#37), TJCTF (#139), and VishwaCTF (#64). The year also witnessed us amassing thousands of CTF points in marquee events like CTF@CIT, Cyber Apocalypse 2025, and BlitzCTF, cementing our presence on the global scoreboard.
        Even before that, in 2024, Ex0rcists proved their strength at ASIS Finals, H7CTF International, IRON CTF, CYBERGON, Z3R0 D4Y CTF, and cruXipher at BITS Hyderabad, demonstrating resilience and consistency against the toughest of challenges.
        <br /><br />
        Our identity goes beyond rankings — we are a collective of hackers, builders, and defenders united by one mantra:"THE RITUAL BEGINS AT ROOT ACCESS."" Every challenge we face is not just a problem to solve, but a vulnerability to exorcise. And with each flag captured, we sharpen our edge in the ever-evolving cyber battlefield.
